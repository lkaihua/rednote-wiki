# Paying Your Cat Tax: A Unique Rednote Tradition of Welcoming New Members

## What is the Cat Tax?

The Cat Tax is a quirky, heartwarming ritual on the Rednote that requires new members to share pictures of their cats (even they own other pets) as a symbolic gesture of joining the community. While it might seem like just a playful activity, the tradition does much more than entertain. It builds an inclusive, engaging culture where members connect through shared joy and personal stories.  

## Its Fun and Unexpected Origins

When TikTok users began migrating to this vibrant Chinese social platform, many were initially unsure about some of its unique traditions, including the concept of paying a Cat Tax. Questions like *“Is this appropriate that we just show up on a foreign soical platform?”* started appearing on TikTok, as curious newcomers discussed the expectations of the Chinese community.

Then, a post from a Chinese girl went viral. In it, she encouraged Americans to "pay your tax" by sharing what you love most: your pets, hobbies, or even beautiful views of your hometown. While people experimented with various ideas, it was the Cat Tax that quickly stole the spotlight. Cute, funny, and universally loved, pet photos resonated deeply with everyone, cementing this ritual as the platform’s signature welcome tradition.  

Before long, the Cat Tax evolved into a widely accepted standard. From goofy cats mid-pounce to dogs proudly wearing tiny hats, Rednote feeds became a treasure trove of pet content that instantly lifted spirits and helped people feel at home.  

## But Why the Cat Tax?

While the tradition seems simple, the Cat Tax holds deeper meaning within the Rednote community. Here are a few reasons it works so well:  

> **“If you also like cats, then you’re probably not a bad person. We can be friends. ^_^”**  

> **“The real meaning is to show off your happiness. Or, in other words, we wish your happiness.”**  

> **“It’s really about sharing your daily lives.”**  

At its heart, the Cat Tax is about human connection. Pets are a part of people’s lives, often representing love, companionship, and humor. By sharing these moments, members open up a little piece of their world, making it easier to forge genuine connections.  

## Why It Matters

The Cat Tax goes beyond just a cute tradition. It creates a sense of belonging and lowers barriers between new and existing members. Even those without pets can participate by sharing a drawing, an old memory, or even a creative take on what their imaginary pet might look like.  

This ritual fosters a lighthearted, nonjudgmental environment where people can bond over shared love for animals or simply enjoy the positive vibes. In an age where online spaces often feel disconnected, the Cat Tax stands out as a beacon of joy and authenticity.  

So, the next time you join Rednote, remember to pay your Cat Tax. Whether it’s a fluffy kitten, a playful dog, or even an eagle with a charming expression, your photo isn’t just a "tax" - it’s a ticket to meaningful connections and a warm welcome into the community.
