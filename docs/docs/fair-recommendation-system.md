# How rednote's Recommendation System Creates a Fair and Engaging Platform  

> [Mike 1969](http://xhslink.com/a/Bewzfb06uX14): 
> Am I using this app correctly or is it just my age (I’m 64)? I seem to have a lot of likes, a lot of follows, but anyone that I talk to stops talking with me after about a week. I’m beginning to think that I’m just too old.

Many social media platforms give influencers an automatic advantage, making it hard for ordinary users to get noticed. **Rednote takes a different approach**, ensuring a **fair and balanced experience for everyone**.  

With rednote, one of your posts might **go viral and get hundreds of likes**, while your other recent posts receive much fewer interactions. This isn’t random—it’s **an intentional design choice**. The system is built to achieve two key goals:  

### 1. Giving Everyone a Chance to Be Seen  
Even if you don’t have a large following, your content can still reach a wide audience if it’s **funny, engaging, or high-quality**. This prevents the platform from being dominated by just a few popular users.  

### 2. Discouraging Low-Quality Spam  
Unlike other platforms where influencers get high engagement no matter what they post, Rednote ensures that **having a lot of followers doesn’t mean automatic success**. If someone repeatedly shares low-effort content, their reach will naturally decrease.  

By focusing on **quality and engagement rather than follower count**, Rednote creates a space where **anyone has the chance to succeed**, and creativity is what truly stands out.


Let's end with a great metaphor that gets lots of thumbs-ups:

> This app just works like this, everyone chats around a single post. It feels just like running into someone for a casual chat while taking a walk.
